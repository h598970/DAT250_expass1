### Experiment 2 discussion

The mapReduce method is useful for many different purposes, in this case we have multiple orders from same customer and many different costumers. One use case where a mapReduce would be useful would be to find The total amount of apples sold, or as in this case how much money each costumer has spent.  What we do in this example is find how much money each costumer has used in total across all orders.
